# 202108271936 Beauty as a strong indicator of relevancy
#beauty #relevancy

Beauty is a trait that induces us to pay attention to whatever we deem to be beautiful. That means beauty can be seen as an indicator of relevancy since relevancy is a reason to pay attention.[[202108131920]]

The saying that beauty is in the eye of the beholder seems to have some truth to it: Relevancy is somewhat specific to the individual.

**Example:**

I like big butt as the great philosopher Sir Mixalot. But not anyone likes big butt. So, me and Sir Mixalot on the one hand find some women to be beautiful while the heretics have their false opinions. But we pay attention to different women because we find different women to be relevant to our lives.

Double nature of beauty.[[202108271952]]
