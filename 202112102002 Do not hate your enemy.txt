Hating the enemy decreases rational and increases irrational behavior. This is not productive.

The relationship to an enemy seems to be emotional. The emotional response to an enemy is instinctive and intense.

Therefore hating the enemy is not a productive way to deal with an enemy since you want to deal with enemies rational and deliberately.
