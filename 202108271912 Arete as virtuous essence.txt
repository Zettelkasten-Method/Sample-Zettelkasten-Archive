## Model

Scale model. Arete is achieved by aiming for the middle. If you have too much or to little of a trait you miss Arete. 

**Example:**

1. Bravery is the virtue [[202108271921 Virtue as ability to overcome resistance]] and part of the Arete of people. 
2. Cowardice is too less.
3. Cockiness it too much.
