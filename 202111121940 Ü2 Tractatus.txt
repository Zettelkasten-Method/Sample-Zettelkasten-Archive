## World

**Hypothesis:** World is an epistemic entity. A fact is not a thing but a statement about things.

**Evidence:**

> [1.1] The world is the totality of facts, not of things. 

> [1.13] The facts in logical space are the world. 

If the world is not placed in what is real but in the logical space the world is an epistemic entity. 

**Hypothesis:** The world is the whole and a fact is part of the world.

**Evidence:**

> [1.1] The world is the totality of facts [...]
> [1.2] The world divides into facts. 

The world is the totality of facts and it divides into facts. Facts are the parts of which the world is constituted.
