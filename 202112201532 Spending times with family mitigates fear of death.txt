Spending time with one's own family ist part of the *Conditio Humana*. As people, we are not strictly separated from animals. Quite the contrary: Being human is not a biological trait you inherit with your genes, but a behavioral confirmation that needs to be acted out consciously in our daily lifes. This makes solving the issue of paternal uncertainty and creating a life in which it is both rational and emotional right to spend time with one's family one of the duties of a man's codex.

The world is never our own world. We are born into the world to die. The world is not for us since we are the presence, and the presence is the point in time that is eternally being-born and dying simultanously. The past is eternally dead. The future is the only thing that is truly alive. This is the true meaning of the saying "The world belongs to our children". If we make spending time with our family part of our codex of being a man we embody at least in part these words of wisdom. Therefore, we men should teach our sons the importance of spending time with family since they are the future dads who inherit this duty.

In the end, spending time with ones family mitigates the fear of death.
