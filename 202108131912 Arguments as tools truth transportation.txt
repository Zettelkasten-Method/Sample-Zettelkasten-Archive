#Arguments #Truth

Arguments are basically tools for truth transportation. The argument form is used to transport truth from the premises to the conclusion.

## Example

Classical Modus Ponens:

(1) All humans are mortal.
(2) I am a human.
...
Therefore: I am mortal.

(1) and (2) are definitely true.
