## Merging feminine and masculine

### Family Time

Spending time with ones family, actually quality time, merges masculine and feminine aspects of manhood:

1. As a man you need to have a good sense of order and exercise authority to set boundaries. (masculine)
2. This authority can on only be put to good use if you always do it for your family. Be selflessly and ask yourself if your authority is exercised with selfless feeling your your family or to boost your ego. (feminine)
3. See the whole and see the context. Don't let yourself be the clown if it diminishes your authority. Never let your ego take over either. (feminine)
4. Be dominant. Be strong. Children admire strength way more than we modern people think. (masculine)

Spending time with your family is not honorable [[202112201528]] just by chance. It feels honorable because it shows how you align with the Self and your mastery over your Ego.
