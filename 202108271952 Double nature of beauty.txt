# 202108271952 Double nature of beauty
#beauty 

Beauty is both subjective and objective.

I like big butt as the great philosopher Sir Mixalot. But not anyone likes big butt. So, me and Sir Mixalot on the one hand find some women to be beautiful while the heretics have their false opinions. But we pay attention to different women because we find different women to be relevant to our lives.

So, there seems to be a double nature of beauty.

1. There are individual differences in relevancy. And if beauty is an indicator of relevancy there is of course differences in the perception of beauty. Beauty is subjective.
2. There are universal components in relevancy. Example: Death is relevant to all of us. If there are universal relevancies to human there is a universal component of beauty.

As seen in the example above.
