#FamilyTime #QualityTime

Spending time with ones family is very important. For a man it is a sign that you build a good life [[202112201529]] and it even mitigates the fear of death [[202112201532]].

Paternal uncertainty and its solution is evidence for truth of it. It is a sign of a good life.

Make it simple: Incorporate rules and rituals that facilitate time spent with the family. Train together with them, eat together, have regular family events. Short: Make it a habit.

To increase the quality, make sure that you are conscious of what you aim for when you spend time with your family. It is about making the lives of your family better and nitting your ties a bit closer. So, if you eat with your family, it is not the time and place to unload your frustrations on your family with the assumption that they can't avoid you like the rest of your day.
