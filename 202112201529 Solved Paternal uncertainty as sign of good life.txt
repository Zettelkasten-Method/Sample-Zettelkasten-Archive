# 202112201529 Solved Paternal uncertainty as sign of good life
#PaternalCertainty

Paternal investment in offspring is a unique human trait compared to the other primates. Paternal investment is tightly linked to paternal certainty. For women, there is not doubt that their children are really theirs. For men, there is the issue of uncertainty. The rationality of their believe of being the biological father of children depends on various factors. It is more rational to trust in being the biological father in a monogamic marriage while living in a small village and being part of a culture that highly values fidelity, than in a casual relationship ("friends with benefits") with no cultural ties to the woman.

This paternal uncertainty is not only a source of stress. The degree of paternal certainty can be seen as the result of the man's capability to create a world in which it is rational to spend time with his family.

Coming from a more virtue based point of view, one can argue that spending time with one's family separates a human male from primates. Spending time with the family is one aspect by which we human improved on our ancestors. So, if you don't spend time with your family as a man, you don't rise above the level of an ape. It makes you primitive if done by choice.
