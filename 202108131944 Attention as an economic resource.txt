Attention is an economic resource. 

Attention is the precursor for decisions. And some decisions are buying decisions. So, sellers need to grab the attention of some people to sell and earn money.

This mechanic is exploited by the attention merchants (See: Tim Wu): Facebook and other social media use cognitive vulnerabilities to hold as much attention from each user to sell this attention to companies.
