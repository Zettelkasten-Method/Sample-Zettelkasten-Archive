> A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man. - *The Godfather* (Mario Puzo)

To become a real man, a man must be complete. You cannot have something missing. Being there for the family is an essential part of a man's life. So, if a man is not spending time with his family the issue is not just that he witholds quality time from its family. He violates his own honor.[[202112201537]]

Paternal uncertainty and its solution is evidence for truth of it. It is a sign of a good life.[[202112201529]]

It even mitigates the fear of death.[[202112201532]]

So: Make spending time with family a habit.[[202112201535]]

Fathering looks beautiful.[[202112201539]]
