This app, like every app, stands on the shoulder of giants. Hundreds of years of human scholarliness culminate in this piece of software. Also, the Internet, electricity, movable type -- thanks for all this, humanity!

There are a couple of people we want to highlight because of their impact on the way we work:

- Niklas Luhmann, for reviving the Zettelkasten method in recent history.
- Zachary Schneirov, creator of Notational Velocity <http://notational.net>, for the "nv core" user experience.
- Brett Terpstra & David Halter, maintainers of nvALT <https://github.com/ttscoff/nv>, for the app that we all used since 2010.
- All the contributors of Open Source Software who helped realize this app without even knowing. Seriously, it's a miracle. Have a look at the "About" window for a list of these.

Enjoy the app, dear user, and say hi on <http://zettelkasten.de/forum> some day and tell us about your journey.
