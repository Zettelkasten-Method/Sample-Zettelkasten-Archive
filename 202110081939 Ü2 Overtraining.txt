## Concept

Cadegiani/Kater proposed instead *Paradoxical Deconditioning Syndrome*.[][#cadegiani2019]

Overtraining is not just about training. It seems to be more likely a dysbalance between anabolic and catabolic factors. 

> (...) OTS rises from unique combinations of risk factors and stressors, rather than excessive training alone.[][#cadegiani2019]

1. **Catabolic Factors:** Physical Stress[][#cadegiani2019] and cognitive stress[][#cadegiani2019] (Working, Studying, Social Stress). 
2. **Anabolic Factors:** Nutrition,[][#cadegiani2019] Sleep,[][#cadegiani2019] 

## Model

Risk Faktors -> Maladaptions -> Overtraining Syndrome

## Symptoms

- Blunted cortisol spike (30min after awaking)[][#cadegiani2018]

## Risk Faktors of Overtraining Syndrome

- mean number of daily hours of work/study >8 hours/day[][#cadegiani2019]
- carbohydrate intake <5.0 g/kg/day[][#cadegiani2019]
- protein intake <1.6 g/kg/day[][#cadegiani2019]
- total daily calorie intake <35 kcal/kg/day[][#cadegiani2019]

## Non-Related Factors to Overtraining Syndrome

- Fat intake (g/kg/day)
