## Thus spoke Zarathustra

1. Truth. 
	- Arguments 
	- Evidence. 
		- Yes, people are most certainly just a step in the evolutionary process. 
2. Relevancy. 
	- There are several insult to the human sense of entitlement. 
		- **Copernican Revolution.** The earth is no longer in the centre of the universe 
		- **Discovery of Evolution:** People are not longer something different than animals but just animals among animals.
		- **Nietzsche:** Ordinary people are just breeding material for elites.
3. Usefulness. 
  - If we see this section as an invitation it could provide us with a sense of awe and belonging. It could open an interesting gateway to spirituality that is untapped.
4. Beauty
	- Evolution can be thought as a flow, a river that is meandering, being in harmony with nature, the world and ultimately with the cosmos. Instead of thinking this section as an insult we could think it as an invitation to being part of something way greater. Making peace with this could be a source of spirituality. (Compare to animism)
5. Simpleness

> I teach you the Beyond-Human. People are something that is to be surpassed. What have ye done to surpass human?
> All beings hitherto have created something beyond themselves: and ye want to be the ebb of that great tide, and would rather go back to the animal than surpass people?
> What is the ape a human? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And just the same shall people be to the Beyond-Human: a laughing-stock, a thing of shame.
> You have made your way from the worm to human, and much within you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even yet people are more of apes than any of the apes.
> Even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid of plant and phantom. But do I bid you become phantoms or plants? (Altered by me)[^2021-09-10-thus-zara]
