Attention is a finite resource.

1. It as limitations short-term. You cannot pay attention to everything at the same time. **Example:** If you concentrate on the screen trying to speak and write English at the same time your dog, which you like a lot, is basically invisible to you.
2. It as limitation mid-term. If you use your attention a lot during the day you will have difficulty to concentrate on something later day.
