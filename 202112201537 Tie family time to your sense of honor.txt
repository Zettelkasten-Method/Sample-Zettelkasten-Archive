#FamilyTime #Honor

Men need a code to live by. With no code, with no honor, men become weak and eventually succumb to the temptations of the expedient and lower vices. Making honor depend on whether we spend time with our family puts the pressure on us that's necessary to prevent us from becoming weak. It saves us from living as if we are not the already-dying present. It saves us from the hazards -- for ourselves and our family -- of self-centeredness.
