#Fathering

If you imagine spending time with your family, you will always be able to find beauty. Even if spending time looks like a Chevy Chase or Adam Sandler Movie there is the hidden beauty of a father being with his family and making it part of his priority. The sight of an invested father fills us with similar joy like like looking at a beautiful painting. It might be less in your face but the beautiful character trait shines through if you open your heart to it.
