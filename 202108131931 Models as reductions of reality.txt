# 202108131931 Models as reductions of reality
#model #reality

Models are reductions of reality. 

1. They need to correspond with reality at least in one common attribute. 
2. They need to exclude attributes that decreases the intended use. 

## Example

A flight simulator is then a good model for flight if it resembles the physics of actual flying.

Included aspects of reality: 

- Physics
- Cause and effect

Excluded of reality:

- The actual plane
- Perhaps, even the cockpit (in case of a use as computer game)
